# LinkedIn Jobs Scraper
A quick scraper I made using Selenium and Discord.py that sends new postings on LinkedIn Jobs for a given search query to a Discord channel. 
I decided to make this after being annoyed at all of the sponsored posts, repeat postings, and also just wanted a better viewing and user
experience. Also supports blacklisting companies through a bot command.

I threw this together in under a day and haven't touched it since so the code quality is terrible and it probably doesn't work out of the box.
